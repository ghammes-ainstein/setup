* One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt),
   H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation.
   For function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the
   brackets:  C-<down> = <C-down>.  The prefixes may be written in
   any order:  M-C-x = C-M-x.
